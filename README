This is a PVR Add-on for XBMC to add N7 network DVB adapters a TV/PVR Backend to XBMC.

It wants to add support for Live TV watching and EPG TV Guide to use over the Network.

For parsing the XML output from the N7 webinterface it uses the xmlParser library developed by Frank Vanden Berghen (http://www.applied-mathematics.net/tools/xmlParser.html). The build scripts are based on Alexander Pipelka's xbmc-addon-xvdr. Many thanks for this!
